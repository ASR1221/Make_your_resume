# Make_your_resume
Type your data to get your resume (arabic only for now).

## Use the website

you can use thewbsite just by following this link : [abdullahsalah.cne-db.com](abdullahsalah.cne-db.com) **EDIT:** This link is not working anymore.

note : this url is for my college so it may hve some not be the fastest. When the project is complete I will use a real url and a good server.
## about the project

This is a test project to get better with html, css and vanilla js

At the end the website is going to generate a html page but there is no PDF.

I tryed HTML2PDF and jsPDF with HTML2Canvas but none of them support rtl writing.

I probably could use an API in the backend but I am not into backend for now, so this project may be real when I finish my full-stack learning.
